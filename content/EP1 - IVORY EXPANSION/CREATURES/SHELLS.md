[[ARMATURES]]

synthetic human extensions; head-bearing designs; continuations of the war, brought to the moon; repurposed into humanity's entertainers

powered by [[RESON]] and made largely out of [[IVORY]]

Shell content Shells (Synthetic Human Extensions and Lunar Lifeforms) are the main protagonists and playable characters of PanProm!

Shells are a race of lunar androids native to The Coronet who fight in competitive battles with Armatures to garnerViewership content Viewership, with a Shell's viewership determining their social rank and level of access to resources.

Characteristics
Self-Repair Abilities
Shells are made out of Ivory content Ivory, letting them repair themselves using moondust. Refined powders purchasable from Fabrication Terminals are often used as more effective repair agents, accelerating repairs and enhancing part durability. The color of their body reflects the type of repair agent used: standard refined powder is white, while cosmetic variants used for their Armature and body parts come in various shades and colors.

Power Supply
Shells are powered by Core content Resonators, granting them the ability to harness Reson content Reson and interface with compatible Armatures. With them, Shells may channel Reson through their bodies to accelerate the repair process of Ivory content Ivory components, letting them heal quickly during battle. They may charge past their normal capacity by crushing Reson Crystals, instantly converting them into usable Reson. However, doing so results in the accumulation of Poisoning content Poisoning that gradually damages and corrupts components.

Reserve Battery
To operate at full power, primary Core content Resonator require the application of a powerful electrical charge. As such, Shells are equipped with a reserve Battery content rechargeable sodium-ion battery.

In the event that a Shell's primary Cores are damaged or disconnected and Reson content Reson cannot be used, this reserve battery will activate and provide a few hours of basic operation.

Core Restrictions
Shells have various Core Restriction content Core Restrictions which dictate and limit their behavior, some of which can be disabled using The Interface.

Sensory Capabilities
Shells have excellent vision, hearing, and kinesthetic senses, but lack senses of taste and smell, and have limited senses of touch and temperature. Shells can only feel through the soft parts of their bodies, typically their face, hair, torso, and the ends of their limbs, and can only detect internal body temperatures. However, the hair of Shells is extremely sensitive to touch, allowing them to register pain and detect subtle movements.

Hair Sensors
Shell hair is exceptionally soft and densely packed with sensors, capable of regrowing if cutâ€”though the process of cutting it is painful. Hair regrows to its original length and shape due to a structural memory that is assigned to it during manufacture. The hair's sensitivity decreases with length; cutting hair near the ends is less painful. The shape of a Shell's hair may change based on their emotional state. The Shells' hair sensitivity means they highly value head pats, head rubs, and hair combing. They also appreciate knitted headwear, though it is rare on the moon. Shells sometimes go through the painful process of cutting their own hair to create headwear as gifts or tokens of apology.

Weather Resistance
Shells exhibit a particularly high resistance to radiation, allowing them to operate safely despite the Moon's Reson content Reson atmosphere significantly increasing ambient radiation levels. However, the level of radiation emitted by Resonance Events remains overwhelmingly lethal for them.

Thanks to their Ivory-based composition, Shells also exhibit an incredible level of resistance to the moon's dust environment. However, prolonged time spent in the elements will result in Shells gradually whitening in color, as their bodies use moondust to repair.

Shells do not possess any liquids in their body. Instead of traditional wet lubricants, they use Ivory-based self-lubricating dry materials similar to molybdenum disulfide and PFTE-based substances.

Shells have a strong aversion to liquids due to interference with their hair and lubrication of their body. Liquid substances can prove to be lethal to Shells if it reaches their internal components, with the exception of Sundew due to its special characteristics and its ability to become a non-conductive liquid.

Cooling Systems
Shells generally use a combination of fans and radiators to cool themselves. In the event that their fans are obstructed or operating in a vacuum environment, they will deactivate to prevent overheating.

Prior to the the activation of The Gate, Shells previously used exclusively radiator-based systems for heat dissipation. The introduction of a Reson content Reson atmosphere on the moon has allowed for smaller radiators and the introduction of fan-based cooling systems.
