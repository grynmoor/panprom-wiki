The lowest habitable sector. Any drop in viewership here will surely result in you being recycled for good. It's sometimes referred to as Sector 20, due to rumors of Sector 10 shells living here, for the greater thrill of fighting where one loss can mean everything. If that rumor is true, it'd have to have some of the best fighters in the entire Coronet, and some of the greatest opportunities to gain viewership.
