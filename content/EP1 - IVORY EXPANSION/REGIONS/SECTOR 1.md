Also known as The Floor. It's the shell recycling center, where those who are destroyed in combat are broken down into reusable matter. According to rumors, some shells have figured out ways to get down here, and have charted out paths to the outside. Contraband goods from the outside are often smuggled in from this sector, and brought into the higher ones. The journey through this sector is extremely dangerous, one wrong step can result in destruction.
