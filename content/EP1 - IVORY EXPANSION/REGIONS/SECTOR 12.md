The balcony. Largely outdoors, it is a nonfunctional sector that contains a large quantity of Reson hazards. The top of the sector contains a thick Reson cloud layer. Some interesting relics and remnants of past history can be found here. Like the sector below it, it's also a deadzone. High purity Reson crystals can be found here, but the process is collecting them is extremely dangerous. Staying here will inevitably result in you contracting Reson poisoning, so you shouldn't stay for long.
