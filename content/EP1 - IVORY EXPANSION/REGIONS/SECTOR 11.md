Nonfunctional sector. It contains a moderate quantity of Reson hazards. It functions as a deadzone, meaning nobody can watch you here. It serves as a temporary respite from the viewership game, but you can't stay here forever. The sector is partially outdoors, allowing for the rare opportunity to see what's outside the Coronet from here.
