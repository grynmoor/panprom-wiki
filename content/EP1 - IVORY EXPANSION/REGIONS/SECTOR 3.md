Very little is known about this sector. It's a low viewership zone, home to unseen struggles of shells fighting for relevancy. Not many enter it, but not many leave it, either. While not uninhabited, the overall shell population is unknown. It likely has some of the oldest shells in the Coronet who stay here, willingly or unwillingly. With very few watching, death here will most likely be final.
