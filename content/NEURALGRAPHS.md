[[ARMATURES]]

i imagine when you go up to characters to interact with them ingame. like as npcs. they have a cool little neuralgraph overlay that represents how your character sees em. its like your mental construct of them
the more you've interacted with em, the bigger the graph gets
i imagine repeat dialogue options are just you replaying what they said to you before when you used that dialogue option on them the first time.
so it avoids that weird issue of npcs just. saying the same shit to you every time you use the same dialogue option on them. its just you replaying a past part of the convo. you're not actually talking to them
maybe there will be a little marker that indicates using a particular dialogue option will actually get a new response from them 

as in "it makes sense to ask them about this again now"
this has always bugged me in games and this feels like an intuitive way to solve it
and there's defo a lot of cool stuff you can do with this
like. if your character dies via reson poisoning and loses memory as a result. using a dialogue option you're technically used before on someone, its going to show up as something you haven't used at all
and your character is going to talk to them about the topic as if it's the first time you're doing it 
but they are kind of like.... we've already talked about this before.... you don't remember?
that feels cool
