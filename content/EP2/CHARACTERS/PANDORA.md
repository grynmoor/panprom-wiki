i don't think i actually decided what plant/animal pandora is based on, but if i had to decide now, it'd probably be various carnivorous plants
the briefcase containing them could work like a venus flytrap.. and said briefcase is held by a fake exoskeletal body 
the fake body could be interpreted as a pitcher plant
because it's. a pitcher. filled with liquid. sundew. and it's the entity they use to make business trades/sales pitches.. they run a black market where they sell classified documents inside the briefcase in exchange for more valuable information 
there's probably also a baseball pun in there and the opportunity to make an OFF reference somewhere 
the exoskeleton does yeet the briefcase in an emergency situation, bc the aphid's true body is inside it

oh my god maybe the aphid core is the fucking baseball
it's a baseball-sized core
much bigger than other aphids' cores. hence it needs more protection. hence why it's inside the extremely durable briefcase along with the classified documents 

pandora is partly named after a black and white cat that i had who has the same name
i imagine the aphid in the briefcase has little catlike eyes looking out at you when its opened

nalulu and pandora have succeeded the most in repressing the aphids' urge to spread love (grooming shells into agreeing to become aphids by indulging them with sensory experiences they're normally incapable of having, bc aphids can only reproduce by transforming consenting individuals). while many of the aphids are happy to provide the sensations of human food, drinks, media, etc in exchange for reson crystals, they tend to warn you against purchasing love. they as aphids have no choice but to offer it to you, it's a natural urge they must follow, and they insist that it's ultimately your choice whether or not to accept love no matter how many times they may ask.
some are more upfront about it, others are more deceptive. nalulu and pandora are amongst the most aromantic, aphids who feed the least on reson crystals, nalulu feeds on ambient reson and themselves, pandora feeds on knowledge and information 

they're both more lazy and conscious about conserving energy because they both abtain from eating reson crystals, primary energy source for aphids
more chill as a result. they don't try to swindle you for anything 

going off from what i said in the lua's gate channel, it would be funny if the pandora aphid literally just used to be a cat, and that's why it's hiding inside of a briefcase and has a human-shaped armored puppet protecting it. it's creating a fake owner
and it's collecting the facility's classified documents to feed its own curiosity
and while it has a much larger core, it's still smaller than the cores of aphids that were originally human 

it's like. being carried around in some kennel LOL

tiny slime catgirl hiding in a briefcase is cute though 

make them megane core nerd
they cannot explain what glasses are, they just like them

omg yes
they could have belonged to their owner so there's a sentimental attachment
and they read books tactile-ly by immersing them in their slime

pandora having a literal cattail plant as a tail, tying into their current plant thematic (venus flytrap, pitcher plant, cattails)

i was thinking pandora's sundew would be more tarlike
chromatic black and its hard to move in it 
like dis

pandora's sundew basically is a variant that metabolises information in addition to reson so it's capable of inducing memory loss if it worms its way inside of your head

unlike reson poisoning which makes you forget all new memories later upon remanufacture, pandora's sundew will make you forget recent past things straight away (but remember very loose fragments upon remanufacture) as well as not be able to form new memories

none of these beat jojo stand wielding shortstack slime catgirl in metal briefcase though
that would be pandora 

the briefcase is the weapon the stand swings it around with her in it and it does more damage because of how thick she is 
she is 2x denser than water

weaponized pet carrier lmfao
when the thickness becomes a game mechanic
Weapon of choice? Why,
Shortstack Slime Catgirl in Metal Briefcase
Evamead is her owner. Pandora is their catgirl secretary she carries important documents for them
They just watch Pandora in carry herself around in her briefcase with her fucking. sentient exoskeleton stand thing
Evamead is just like "I'm going to murder you with my thick cat." 

"Pandora rip his balls off"
Pandora just goes "Yare yare daze, nya..." 

we're hitting brainrot's gate stage now
and i'm all for it

the entire starlit district is already brainrot capital literally
Pandora is on a strict meme-only diet because aphids can metabolize information
But it's way less energy-dense than reson
Its like eating a fibrous salad.... 
Hence why aphids can turn shells who are robots/information-based beings into aphids 

Evamead fed Pandora all of the academic papers in the Starlit District hence why you barely find any LOL
"Lore? I ate those food"
Academic paper is scrumptious and filling
Eating meme is like eating potato chip
Evamead probably carries around a stash of memes on a flash drive, knowing Pandora needs a constant supply of low-energy "snacks" to stay motivated.
Imagine them scrolling through old forums or corrupted data caches, with Evamead muttering, “Here, Pandora. Eat this doge gif while I think.” 
mf is just trying to take care of their cat 

every time pandora tries eating a reson crystal evamead swats it away from them
pandora is really smart because she ate all the fucking lore. you are what you eat. shes the lorekeeper now

no wonder shes so thick. shes got 900 petabytes in there. pun intended 
damn. that ass really is smart 

9... hundred... petabytes. 

i love how the lack of meaningful lore in the starlit district despite it being where all the humans lived is bc pandora literally ate all of it and became thick lore cat as a result
this is the best possible explanation 
the remnants of human history on the moon are now compressed in catgirl thighs
