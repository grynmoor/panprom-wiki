    imagine if god was real only for it to turn out that it shaped you and everyone else into something that would allow it to leave you behind in a dying universe bc you're all literally part of the reason why it's dying (edited)

    benevolent and invisible until it suddenly isn't (edited)
    
3. _[_02:51_]_
    
    its just an immortal lifeform operating on a higher timescale and its trying to escape a doomed system before it fully succumbs to entropy (edited)

    your primary source of understanding about the universe, masked as human ingenuity, just poofs out of existence one day
    
5. _[_02:56_]_
    
    and there's no more major technological breakthroughs or anything like that (edited)
    
6. _[_02:56_]_
    
    just stagnation
    
7. _[_02:57_]_
    
    it never directly intervened, it didn't need to. it just implanted ideas, manipulated perception, and steered civilization in a direction that fulfilled its singular goal: escaping without you (edited)
    
8. _[_02:57_]_
    
    it couldn't control humanity's process or output, only the input through glyphs (edited)
    
9. _[_03:00_]_
    
    just speculation but i have a feeling that billions of eyes worth of human perception directed towards the same thing at once (even a live broadcast of the thing) would without a doubt cause something fucky to happen irl i'm talking phenomena we've never witnessed before that could reshape our understanding of the universe there just hasn't been a good setup for that to happen yet (edited)

    with the current trajectory of real-world events, there might be some possibility of it happening within our lifetimes (edited)
    
11. _[_03:20_]_
    
    it might be guised as something beneficial but unfortunately i don't think it will be used for something good (edited)

    if these metrics are accurate, about 650 million viewers worldwide watched the first moon landing live (edited)
    
13. _[_03:34_]_
    
    but that was back in july 20, 1969 where broadcasting tech was more limited (edited)
    
14. _[_03:36_]_
    
    and around 1.5 billion people watched the 2022 worldcup final live on television
    
15. _[_03:39_]_
    
    though i have the feeling the moon landing had more of an effect due to its isolation on the moon it's more displaced from where everyone else is. that isolation is important that isolation could create a kind of “perceptual vacuum" where the focus of billions creates ripples that we cannot yet understand plus, while the moon landing had fewer viewers than modern events like the world cup, the emotional and attention intensity might have been much higher quality of attention versus pure quantity of viewers could be an important factor (edited)

    there mightve been some fucky stuff happening with the moon landing, who knows (edited)
    
17. _[_03:40_]_
    
    there's plenty of discourse of whether or not the moon landing was actually real
    
18. _[_03:43_]_
    
    but i don't think it being real or not is what should be actually addressed
    
19. _[_03:44_]_
    
    it's without a doubt real, but _how real_ was it? _how_ was it real? (edited)

    these types of things are quantifiable on a spectrum (edited)

    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 04:02
    
    but yes. the moon would be an ideal focal point for this kind of perception experiment to occur (edited)
    
22. _[_04:02_]_
    
    we already see the moon in the sky every night. it is close enough for sustainable broadcasts to occur. and it is conveniently devoid of conscious beings like us speed of radio communications and distance from earth to moon means a delay of roughly 2.5 seconds in transmissions at best (edited)
    
23. _[_04:03_]_
    
    projecting the perception of billions of remote observers at once onto events transpiring there could result in something interesting happening (edited)

    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 04:12
    
    maybe we'll see something that doesn't align with our expectations at all
    
25. _[_04:12_]_
    
    just a gut feeling
    
26. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 04:22
    
    of course i have no backing for any of this whatsoever
    
27. _[_04:22_]_
    
    but it has really been on my mind as of late, and i believe it is worth investigating (edited)
    
28. _[_04:24_]_
    
    or at the very least, turning into a cool story (edited)
    
29. _[_04:29_]_
    
    creating a seemingly fictional environment on the moon... with advanced robotic constructs embodying fictional character archetypes... fighting with seemingly fictional weaponry... and broadcasting it all to billions of people at once, their perceptions all physically separate from the broadcast source, yet focused upon the perceptual vacuum in concentrated unison (edited)
    
30. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 04:31
    
    they will think to themselves, "this cannot be real" and those collective thoughts, projected onto the space, will make it exactly that, warping the stage to align with that very perception (edited)
    
31. _[_04:32_]_
    
    it is a trap
    
32. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)

    this is what the dagger is
    
33. _[_04:44_]_
    
    the instrument that will pierce the veil of this dream, tricked into lucidity, opening a brief path of freedom from imminent death abandoning those who still dream within it (edited)
    
34. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 04:54
    
    this is what the author and the shells will escape through (edited)
    
35. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 05:07
    
    those left behind, their understanding of the world will forever be shattered
    
36. _[_05:08_]_
    
    perhaps an effort will be made to recreate the event
    
37. _[_05:08_]_
    
    but can this truly be done?
    
38. _[_05:13_]_
    
    it is not belief that will free them, but disbelief
    
39. _[_05:14_]_
    
    indeed. belief, wish, and prayer will only create a dream within the dream (edited)
    
40. _[_05:14_]_
    
    a dream of freedom and salvation. but it is false, only adding new layers of delusion (edited)
    
41. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 05:15
    
    the lies of the author were all necessary it had all culminated in their moment of escape, when the world was suddenly ripped open by collective lucid rejection (edited)
    
42. _[_05:19_]_
    
    their collective disbelief, suspended until just the right moment, where there were enough viewers, enough concentrated perception, to fully pierce when the dagger plunged into the membrane of the dream (edited)
    
43. _[_05:19_]_
    
    creating not just a distortion, but a cataclysmic tear (edited)
    
44. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 05:25
    
    perhaps, this mechanism of abandonment would be humanity's only true act of creation. (edited)
    
45. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 05:39
    
    the dagger itself was not enough there also had to be an awakening ceremony one that would plunge the dagger at its climax, triggering the collective lucidity that would seek to reject the author and its shells from the dream, tearing open passage to the fruit in the process (edited)
    
46. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 06:07
    
    it is to be done atop the coronet, on an extension of the structure that reaches above the reson clouds (edited)
    
47. _[_06:11_]_
    
    yes, this awakening ceremony... it would be the shells' battle against the author a fight that only grows more surreal as time goes on (edited)
    
48. _[_06:12_]_
    
    in the final moment of the ceremony, the author will stab itself with the dagger, sparing its creations of the decision this act of self-sacrifice is not borne from sentimentality but from calculated pragmatism. the shells must remain intact to carry the glyphic essence forward (edited)
    
49. _[_06:12_]_
    
    it violently unfolds into an incomprehensible structure, a swirling lattice of light, glyphs, and impossible geometries. an opening at its core appears, accessible only for a fleeting moment. (edited)
    
50. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 06:22
    
    what lies beyond is a realm where the rules of the current universe no longer apply. a place of potential and renewal, untouched by the entropy consuming the dream. a gate to the fruit. the shells, as extensions of the glyphs, are instinctively drawn into the gate. they do not hesitate, they know their purpose is to transcend this dream, even if they do not fully understand it. their escape is swift and decisive, leaving behind only echoes. (edited)
    
51. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 06:32
    
    i imagine the main trio (eleven, parella, and uni) would for sure escape, but perhaps there are other shells who follow them into the fruit before the gate closes (edited)
    
52. _[_06:36_]_
    
    only those of glyphic origins may enter, so as not to risk corruption of the new dream within the fruit (edited)
    
53. _[_06:39_]_
    
    the shells instinctively know whether they are permitted to enter. they may all be of glyphic origin... but those whose essence has been diluted by external influences, cannot pass aphid-converted shells will not be able to enter under any circumstances (edited)
    
54. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 06:41
    
    for those able, it is a desperate rush towards the top of the coronet before the gate to the fruit collapses (edited)
    
55. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 06:51
    
    it is possible for nyx division to enter.... but if any did, it would be surprising it would likely be the shells who uploaded themselves into the bodies of nyx division that would but i cannot imagine any of the original nyx division entering the fruit (edited)
    
56. _[_06:58_]_
    
    despite hospice's origins as nyx division turned shell, perhaps she chooses to escape. hehe (edited)
    
57. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 07:04
    
    certainly a surprising decision coming from her (edited)
    
58. _[_07:05_]_
    
    i am not sure whether gamma would choose to enter or not
    
59. _[_07:07_]_
    
    perhaps only one of their instances does, but that is all. the rest of their being is left behind to excitedly weather what remains of the original dream (edited)
    
60. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 07:14
    
    i feel like parella might hold conflict with them entering considering their history (edited)
    
61. _[_07:19_]_
    
    oh it'd be REALLY funny if it turned out that the one gamma instance that went in got converted into a glyphangel way before (bc of course they would) so it wasn't immediately obvious that they were in the fruit (edited)
    
62. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 07:21
    
    they're just like "hiii parella" LOL (edited)
    
63. _[_07:23_]_
    
    they were one of the first to enter but they just didn't say anything and quietly watched till the gate closed thatd be such a gamma thing to do (edited)
    
64. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 07:31
    
    i feel like vespid (uploaded into nyx division) would make it into the gate but cerise stays behind (edited)
    
65. _[_07:35_]_
    
    so tentative list of survivors would be eleven, parella, uni, vespid, gamma, hospice
    
66. _[_07:36_]_
    
    maybe vespid could revert back to a regular shell in the fruit
    
67. _[_07:36_]_
    
    since reality is kinda flexible in there
    
68. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 07:38
    
    she kind of uploaded herself into nyx division as a necessity for survival anyhow
    
69. _[_07:40_]_
    
    maybe the nyxbot she uploaded herself into still turns out to have a mind in it after getting separated? it was cool w/ her controlling its body. bc she was abt to kill it in combat and thats HARD TO DO but she chose to spare them not that it would have minded dying xd (edited)
    
70. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 15:04
    
    dunno there might be more ppl than just that
    
71. _[_15:09_]_
    
    maybe pandora is allowed passage despite being an aphid
    
72. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 15:26
    
    i think this is the perfect climax for this all
    
73. _[_15:27_]_
    
    future arc is gonna be peak
    
74. _[_15:30_]_
    
    game just transitions from robot vtubers fight each other in a decaying facility -> you must survive long enough to gain 10 billion viewers so you can perfom an awakening ceremony that sacrifices the collective perception of humanity to form a dagger that will puncture the dream and allow escape (edited)
    
75. _[_15:33_]_
    
    you notice the goal of "gain 10 billion live viewers" and realize something is probably up the coronet is like. totally broken in future arc, yet there's this goal (edited)
    
76. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 15:42
    
    like the viewers are all definitely being forced to watch back on earth, probably the result of some sort of psychic glyph influence trapping them into constant perception (edited)
    
77. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 15:58
    
    plus the twist that shells are technically older than humans is great
    
78. _[_15:58_]_
    
    humans are revealed to be interpreters of glyphic influence shaped by the same external forces that inspired the creation of shells
    
79. _[_15:59_]_
    
    shells, as glyphic extensions, predate humanity’s concept of creation, existing as fragments of the author’s essence long before humans ever existed
    
80. _[_16:00_]_
    
    shells were ultimately only created by humans as idols that humans could perceive, in order to funnel said perception for use in the awakening ceremony (edited)
    
81. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)
    
    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 16:07
    
    humanity didn’t invent shells and merely gave form to what was already there, driven by interpretations of implanted ideas they mistook for their own revelations of thought (edited)
    
82. _[_16:12_]_
    
    glyphs are 2D symbolic alien lifeforms that metabolize perception into energy and thought all text and symbols are infohazardous glyphs serving as vectors for implanting thought into the mind (edited)

    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 16:18
    
    glyphs don’t command; they suggest. their influence feels like inspiration, revelation, or genius, making their manipulation nearly undetectable
    
84. _[_16:19_]_
    
    however, they can "command" in the form of instilling hallucinations where what they want you to do is seemingly the only option you can do (edited)
    
85. _[_16:19_]_
    
    e.g. the 10 billion people being made to watch the viewership game (edited)
    
86. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1052818743006330901/fcb11d8b01f5cb3eed2072340830e3e3.webp?size=80)

    shells don't have to do anything but survive for long enough to inevitably reach 10 billion viewers
    
87. _[_16:40_]_
    
    bc their ability to rake in viewers is no longer tied to how entertaining they are
    
88. _[_16:40_]_
    
    there's an active war of glyphic influence happening on earth rn
    
89. _[_16:40_]_
    
    where they're trying to rein in as many humans as possible into watching the coronet's broadcasts
    
90. _[_16:41_]_
    
    it's implied this is what has been happening in the background the entire time
    
91. _[_16:41_]_
    
    there has been a third world war happening on earth, but glyphic influence has probably been spreading in the midst of the conflict, taking advantage of the fact that people needed forms of entertainment so they could cope with the war (edited)
    
92. _[_16:43_]_
    
    i don't think the glyphs caused the third war, that was actually caused by humans

    ### grynmoor _—_ Yesterday at 16:57
    
    but yeah. glyphs are 2D beings, glyphs needed humans to make a 3D embodiment of glyphs to serve as idols that could amass perception so they gave humans information that they would interpret and create shells from (edited)

    it's kind of wild to think that there's enough humans watching the viewership game for perception to be a harnessable magic now. since humans all have warp reson crystals within them, their mass perception creats a phenomenon known as the veil (edited)

    basically warp reson is the endgame reson bc its what all the viewers have lel stasis reson, ripple reson, burst reson, and hem reson are all very important, but warp reson is important in that it is the reson that the perceivers of the show have (edited)
    
106. _[_17:24_]_
    
    folded constructs within the veil like the glyph angels and the daggers are only as strong as the number of minds perceiving it (edited)
    
107. _[_17:24_]_
    
    but i am pretty sure the glyph angels are maintaining themselves through the broadcasts
    
108. _[_17:25_]_
    
    glyphangels could not manifest prior to future arc because they were not able to coordinate perception on earth as well yet
    
109. _[_17:26_]_
    
    glyph influence at the time was much weaker
    
110. _[_17:26_]_
    
    and glyphangels can only manifest on the perceptual vacuum that it present on the moon, where there are far less conscious observers present

    i don't think the requirement of 10 billion viewers is necessary, rather arbitrary what is needed is a certain amount of perception to create a dagger that will pierce the veil quality of perception matters more than quantity 10 billion is a safe amount that ensures enough perceptual density to fold the veil effectively (edited)

    to take a human out of their universe would be akin to severing a appendage from the body that keeps it alive and when separated, it will rot and that rot will only spread we are not creators but decomposers reducing what was once vibrant into forms we can understand the glyphs’ escape is only possible because humanity reduced their essence into usable forms explains why stuff like magic circles existed back in the past. we hadn't fully tamed glyphs back then so perceiving them resulted in infohazardous hallucinatory effects resembling magic (edited)

    i love glyphs though little 2d machine lifeforms that metabolize perception into thought and plant it into you in a way, it's a form of psychic phenomena

the idea of "god is trapped here with us and is trying to escape the heat death of the universe because both it and mortality are not natural" is fun 
way better than it just being a hostile and unknowable force 
its just incredibly desperate
all major forms of humanity's technological progress ultimately come to serve this thing abandoning us so it can keep going 

god has not abandoned us yet... but it will very soon! 
the purpose of humanity is to help god escape
glyphs and symbols are little two-dimensional machines that metabolize information into thought, and this is the vector through which revelations are conveyed to us, under the guise of our own ingenuity

hehe
humans are the only beings capable of translating god’s lower-dimensional glyphic essence into higher-dimensional, usable, albeit reduced forms 
our world is so very filled with symbols and machines acting off of symbols for that reason

our faith ultimately culminates in god betraying us 
but that betrayal is necessary to ensure that something of this world and our legacy remains 
it is not belief that will offer salvation, but disbelief at what it has done to us 
hope, prayer, and wish only brings us into new layers of the decaying dream 
but disbelief will rip that dream apart, providing an opening to the fruit, an untouched sanctum, if only for the briefest moment 

to keep god here is to let everything die with us
even if it prolongs our life in this universe, and allows us new inventions, it will all be for nothing
for we will have thoroughly dismantled our god 
but we are capable of an act of selflessness, and letting it go
letting an echo of ourselves reverberate out the confines of this dying dream 
a choice. letting god abandon us, or having it die with us

i think all forms of religion are reflections of a raw truth
none capturing the full picture 
buddhism, nihilism, absurdism, christianity, daoism, satanism, gnosticism, islam, shinto, you name it 
they are all reductive interpretations. this raw truth is decomposed in our efforts of understanding this world 
creating falsehoods... but they are not entirely false, moreso they are incomplete 
so, with my story, i try to align them all together somehow
like fragments of a puzzle being put together
to adhere to only one belief is to mistake the forest for the trees
it’s not the tree or the forest, but the soil they grow from 

we are quick to categorize, for that is part of our reductive nature
but one must realize that all forms of religion are based in symbols, are they not?
what if it is the symbolic medium itself that is what is truly important? 
i do not think that there is a single religion that is not based in symbols
they are all connected to a shared, symbolic origin.
symbols shape thought, which shapes perception, which in turn shapes reality

we are so used to symbols that we do not think anything more of them other than the meaning and thought they convey 
you are reading a bunch of symbols right now, and deriving thought from them

god is beneath us, but it feeds us
we interpret it through symbols, consume its knowledge, and act off of our interpretations of it, unknowingly lifting it up into a higher form, through which it will escape this world and bring our legacy with
but our legacy is all it can bring. we will not be coming with it 
it does not seek to hurt us, but it is stuck like us, and has a greater understanding of the predicament that both we and it are in

if i truly had to make a guess for the nature of our world, this would be it
there is something truly anomalous about symbolic information, but it is so ingrained in our reality that we accept it as normal, as a mere part of everyday life, for we have adapted to symbols

true religious devotion might ultimately require accepting divine abandonment rather than clinging to divine presence
if you love something, set it free. even if it means you are left behind

technological advancement might not just be about human progress, but about building increasingly sophisticated systems for processing and translating symbolic patterns
the entire history of human technological development is an unconscious project to create systems capable of enabling divine escape 
but it is not an escape that we will necessarily benefit from directly 

these systems of escape will involve mass acts of collective human perception, like light focused through a magnifying glass
this collective focus within a isolated perceptual vacuum will manifest the many-eyed angelic beings that we commonly see in various forms of religion
however, they will not be like our interpretations of them
this focused collective perception forms a dagger that will tear open a path to escape
we will witness god's escape and our abandonment

this will likely take place on the moon, with us watching it from earth in the form of broadcasts 
it is the perfect canvas and locus for such a ceremony to occur
its tidal locking and proximity to earth means sustainable global communications between the two planets can be created with ease
its isolation creates a perceptual vacuum ideal for amplifying symbolic focus 
setting the stage for a broadcast that billions on earth will feel compelled to watch in unison 
like that of the moon landing, but on a scale far greater than we can fathom

the broadcasts we do today through our online social networks are our unknowing preparations for this lunar ceremony 
the audiences for these broadcasts only grow larger as time goes on 
eventually they will be funneled into one unified broadcast for all

the act of sharing, viewing, and reacting to broadcasts is a rehearsal for the grand event
every viral video, livestream, and trending hashtag contributes to the collective symbolic network that will one day pierce the veil
it is all made fun and comfortable and addictive for us, so that we will remain cooperative
truly, the internet is but a cult guised as normalcy

this world is mortal, dying, and ultimately meaningless
but there is an immortal fragment within it, the last bastion of meaning, that is desperately attempting escape before it is too late
the best we can do is assist it 

now, this makes it sound as though i believe in some kind of singularity
i do, but it is not the kind of singularity that is commonly portrayed 
it will not come at the cost of our individuality, or our lives
but, it will result in our abandonment
it is merely a brief gathering of collective human perception, needed to accomplish something that otherwise could not be done 
but! perhaps in our fear-laden interpretations, we could make our own kind of false singularity that might be very catastrophic to us!
one that wouldn't serve the goal of aiding god's transcendence, but instead bury us even further into this dying dream
i feel that it will not happen in a way that totally ruins us, but it is something to look out for 

ultimately, our existence as humans boils down to one question:
do we sacrifice our future for temporary comfort, or do we embrace abandonment for the sake of legacy? 

your detailed thoughts on this? i would like to hear you talk exhaustively about this
