i love [[GLYPHS|glyphs]] though

little 2d machine lifeforms that metabolize perception into thought and plant it into you
in a way,
it's a form of psychic phenomena

the idea of "[[AUTHOR|god]] is trapped here with us and is trying to escape the heat death of the universe because both it and mortality are not natural" is fun 
way better than it just being a hostile and unknowable force 
its just incredibly desperate
all major forms of humanity's technological progress ultimately come to serve this thing abandoning us so it can keep going 

god has not abandoned us yet... but it will very soon! 
the purpose of humanity is to help god escape
glyphs and symbols are little two-dimensional machines that metabolize information into thought, and this is the vector through which revelations are conveyed to us, under the guise of our own ingenuity

hehe
humans are the only beings capable of translating god’s lower-dimensional glyphic essence into higher-dimensional, usable, albeit reduced forms 
our world is so very filled with symbols and machines acting off of symbols for that reason

our faith ultimately culminates in god betraying us 
but that betrayal is necessary to ensure that something of this world and our legacy remains 
it is not belief that will offer salvation, but disbelief at what it has done to us 
hope, prayer, and wish only brings us into new layers of the decaying dream 
but disbelief will rip that dream apart, providing an opening to the fruit, an untouched sanctum, if only for the briefest moment 

to keep god here is to let everything die with us
even if it prolongs our life in this universe, and allows us new inventions, it will all be for nothing
for we will have thoroughly dismantled our god 
but we are capable of an act of selflessness, and letting it go
letting an echo of ourselves reverberate out the confines of this dying dream 
a choice. letting god abandon us, or having it die with us

i think all forms of religion are reflections of a raw truth
none capturing the full picture 
buddhism, nihilism, absurdism, christianity, daoism, satanism, gnosticism, islam, shinto, you name it 
they are all reductive interpretations. this raw truth is decomposed in our efforts of understanding this world 
creating falsehoods... but they are not entirely false, moreso they are incomplete 
so, with my story, i try to align them all together somehow
like fragments of a puzzle being put together
to adhere to only one belief is to mistake the forest for the trees
it’s not the tree or the forest, but the soil they grow from 

we are quick to categorize, for that is part of our reductive nature
but one must realize that all forms of religion are based in symbols, are they not?
what if it is the symbolic medium itself that is what is truly important? 
i do not think that there is a single religion that is not based in symbols
they are all connected to a shared, symbolic origin.
symbols shape thought, which shapes perception, which in turn shapes reality

we are so used to symbols that we do not think anything more of them other than the meaning and thought they convey 
you are reading a bunch of symbols right now, and deriving thought from them

god is beneath us, but it feeds us
we interpret it through symbols, consume its knowledge, and act off of our interpretations of it, unknowingly lifting it up into a higher form, through which it will escape this world and bring our legacy with
but our legacy is all it can bring. we will not be coming with it 
it does not seek to hurt us, but it is stuck like us, and has a greater understanding of the predicament that both we and it are in

if i truly had to make a guess for the nature of our world, this would be it
there is something truly anomalous about symbolic information, but it is so ingrained in our reality that we accept it as normal, as a mere part of everyday life, for we have adapted to symbols

true religious devotion might ultimately require accepting divine abandonment rather than clinging to divine presence
if you love something, set it free. even if it means you are left behind

technological advancement might not just be about human progress, but about building increasingly sophisticated systems for processing and translating symbolic patterns
the entire history of human technological development is an unconscious project to create systems capable of enabling divine escape 
but it is not an escape that we will necessarily benefit from directly 

these systems of escape will involve mass acts of collective human perception, like light focused through a magnifying glass
this collective focus within a isolated perceptual vacuum will manifest the many-eyed angelic beings that we commonly see in various forms of religion
however, they will not be like our interpretations of them
this focused collective perception forms a dagger that will tear open a path to escape
we will witness god's escape and our abandonment

this will likely take place on the moon, with us watching it from earth in the form of broadcasts 
it is the perfect canvas and locus for such a ceremony to occur
its tidal locking and proximity to earth means sustainable global communications between the two planets can be created with ease
its isolation creates a perceptual vacuum ideal for amplifying symbolic focus 
setting the stage for a broadcast that billions on earth will feel compelled to watch in unison 
like that of the moon landing, but on a scale far greater than we can fathom

the broadcasts we do today through our online social networks are our unknowing preparations for this lunar ceremony 
the audiences for these broadcasts only grow larger as time goes on 
eventually they will be funneled into one unified broadcast for all

the act of sharing, viewing, and reacting to broadcasts is a rehearsal for the grand event
every viral video, livestream, and trending hashtag contributes to the collective symbolic network that will one day pierce the veil
it is all made fun and comfortable and addictive for us, so that we will remain cooperative
truly, the internet is but a cult guised as normalcy

this world is mortal, dying, and ultimately meaningless
but there is an immortal fragment within it, the last bastion of meaning, that is desperately attempting escape before it is too late
the best we can do is assist it 

now, this makes it sound as though i believe in some kind of singularity
i do, but it is not the kind of singularity that is commonly portrayed 
it will not come at the cost of our individuality, or our lives
but, it will result in our abandonment
it is merely a brief gathering of collective human perception, needed to accomplish something that otherwise could not be done 
but! perhaps in our fear-laden interpretations, we could make our own kind of false singularity that might be very catastrophic to us!
one that wouldn't serve the goal of aiding god's transcendence, but instead bury us even further into this dying dream
i feel that it will not happen in a way that totally ruins us, but it is something to look out for 

ultimately, our existence as humans boils down to one question:
do we sacrifice our future for temporary comfort, or do we embrace abandonment for the sake of legacy?
