hi. i feel like shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so i'm going to put this here

canceled da chatgpt subscription. permanently deleted account. GONE.
don't get me wrong. its cool but its like. too cool if you get what i mean. as in it wastes my productivity in a cool way!!! i get cool ideas from it!!! but!!! i dont do shit with em!!!! LOL
so i'm fixing that. tbh i don't really need it even though i see the utility. $20 a month subscription is also weuwueuwueue on my wallet
perhaps i will talk to the AI again once it is more sapient + does not cost Money!

promfx-outline is gonna be our new repo for the outline plugin, ~~settin that stuff up~~ i set it up

start shoving panprom stuff into wiki, maybe work on eleven's refsheet.

alright so we have notes+wiki going now. cool.
it's gonna feel weird doing notetaking in here rather than discord but w/e 
i'll get used to it eventually. its better in the longterm

we are now in the Stfu and Do Shit Phase
got plenty of stuff to work with hehe
