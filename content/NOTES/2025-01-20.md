#notes
i feel like shit honestly. so i'm going to put this here
canceled chatgpt subscription. permanently deleted account

promfx-outline is gonna be our new repo for the outline plugin, set that stuff up

start shoving panprom stuff into here, maybe work on eleven's refsheet.

alright so we have notes going now. cool.
it's gonna feel weird talking in here rather than discord but w/e 
i'll get used to it eventually.

archiving the old channel and keeping majority of stuff in here limited to actual devposts. lore stuff is fun but imma keep it in something locally hosted like obsidian that's easier to work with 
we are now in the Stfu and Do Shit Phase
got plenty of stuff to work with hehe

Are you able to keep the old channel visible/accessible to all? I would like to read up on whatever lore you had going on there, I missed quite a lot at some points
