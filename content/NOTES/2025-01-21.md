[[ELEVEN|elebun]].........
gonna make a refsheet for her so i can model her
i love her goofy little antennae

even tho shes as close as factory default as the coronet could make her, there's still some stuff that the coronet had to explicitly pick out for her

like her appearance. its an unused shell model. coronet just picked the one that was the least flashy looking 

she doesnt start off with the twintails, she gets instanced w/o them 

like her whole purpose was to not be good at the viewership game so she'd fail her first debut match and coronet could quietly guide her along in the lower sectors

to do her job of deallocating the warshells... but that failed ofc

now she's just an idolshell with task manager privileges who could theoretically deallocate
everyone if she ever becomes aware of the fact that she can just. erase ppl w/ her reson crucible 

i don't remember if i had specific design stuff in mind for her previously but i like her design enough to just iterate off it

she actually kind of looks like a navshell, which i like 

i like the idea of her ingame name literally just being 11 that would be funny

i imagine her friends would shorten her name to El or something 
el chan.....

plus u can do something cute like pare11a

if u go off the greek letter naming convention that the navshells have, eleven would be named lambda

i like that lore for 11... started off as a blank navshell template that inadvertently became an idolshell

said navshell template has residual parts of uni's neuralgraph in it 

bc rlly its just a copy of uni that got hollowed out and turned into a reusable template
hospice and uni are both navshells of alpha designation (they are equipped to manage coronet operations)

hospice is the original whereas uni is an alpha surrogate 

hospice and uni both have access to ppls neuralgraphs. hospice uses them to create shells, uni uses them to maintain neuralgraph stability of shells by taking upon a therapist role in the starlit district 

so uni sort of functions as a backup key for the coronet

and eleven is a backup key of that backup key, sorta

eleven isn't exactly uni enough to inherit anything that uni could do

but there's a bunch of other idolshells that have different parts of uni in them 

so u could theoretically reconstruct uni by splicing their neuralgraphs together

it won't be uni, but close enough for the reconstruction to do what uni could

what will the reconstruction of uni allow for? buying time for the coronet

not much else really

maybe restoring some parts of the coronet that previously couldn't be restored 

i guess u could call it a... reunion.... hehehehe

the whole uni thing is definitely postgame content

reconstructing the neuralgraph of the alpha surrogate to buy the coronet some time but also bring parella's friend back from the dead

and give the shells a very important person who can keep them stable through it all

i think the idolshells having as much mental stability as they do is partly because there's tiny parts of uni in mostly everyone

like uni's neuralgraph is very good at self-regulation

so the coronet just put parts of it in everyone so they don't go crazy

shells have some weird equivalent of genetics bc of how their neuralgraphs work and how the coronet has no choice but to recycle stuff due to resource limitations 

eleven is more like uni purely because eleven's neuralgraph started off as a hollowed out copy of uni's, and there was no prompt to bury any of the uni-like traits beneath the surface right off the bat 

after reson completely fucked up the facility, all shells that have been instanced since then pretty much have uni as their subconscious

bc it keeps them more stable
