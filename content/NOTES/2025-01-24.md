tempted to add a small amount of red somewhere in [[ELEVEN|eleven's]] design. might do it in the form of subtle component lights
might allow for a cool cyan/red chromatic anaglyph effect too
if her hidden eye was red.... that would be neat but maybe too on the nose lol

observation i've had of something i've been doing without realizing it: [[IDOLSHELLS|idolshells]] instanced by normal means do not often possess antennae

its often [[WARSHELLS|warshells]] and [[NAVSHELLS|navshells]] that have them
like [[CERISE|cerise]] and [[PARELLA|parella]] and [[CROQUET|croquet]] don't have any
well ok maybe croquet has them but they're stylized as bunny ears
all [[SHELLS|shells]] do possess earpiece modules around where the ears would but they are typically flat and don't really look like human ears. often covered up by hair as well
but some shells also possess antennae in addition to that
[[ELEVEN|eleven]] has a fun mix of earpieces + antennae
and her earpieces are big enough to not be entirely covered by the hair
[[VESPID|vespid]] also has bigger earpieces and they are cone-shaped
[[GAMMA|gamma]] has an earpiece that also doubles as an antenna
[[FRUTIGER|frutiger]] has one double-pronged antenna on one side of her head, it almost looks like a router
oh wait... parella actually does have horns.. i forgot about that
i guess with idolshells it's harder to tell bc their antennae are often stylized

realizing 11 (the number) visually resembles a pause button
and eleven uses [[STASIS RESON|stasis reson]]
thats cool as fuck actually
im tempted to shove more tv remote themed stuff into the shells
triangle inscribed within circle is already kind of a prominent symbol
and that resembles a play button
also a symbol of unity of the divine and material, and also of sobriety and rehabilitation
mind, body, spirit
also connects to trinity
both the religious concept, and the nuclear bomb hehe

thinking of how [[THE CORONET|the coronet]]'s 13 sectors is loosely tied to US+JP education systems
most education systems have 12 years worth of education
[[SECTOR 13|sector 13]], the topmost sector in the [[RESON CLOUDS|reson clouds]], would be a "graduation sector" where you go to find higher knowledge. oftentimes you don't return from this, since the [[RESON|reson]] clouds seemingly erase you
of course the real-world equivalent for this would be university. 13's also a pretty unlucky number on top of that. some buildings don't have a 13th floor
the [[IDOLSHELLS|idolshells]], being ageless, means the sectors don't necessarily represent level of age/education, they're just the places where the [[SHELLS|shells]] can operate and said places loosely correlate with [[VIEWERSHIP|viewership]]
the lower down a sector is, the closer the shells inhabiting it are to their roots of war typically
meaning, the shells in the lower sectors are often less caring about extrinsic demands
the [[WARSHELLS|warshells]] in the lower sectors just fight without any care about viewership, and they aren't even tied to it
12 is a pretty important number in shell culture anyhow
12 visitable sectors, 12 episodes in a season
12 [[EARTH|earth]] days of operational life
12 is also the month of december and christmas, which is associated with [[SANTA|santa]]
12 is representative of boundaries, and the act of reaching them
whereas 13 is what lies beyond it all
[[PROMENADES|promenades]] for shells are essentially dances of death where they fight in battle for the sake of performance
to die without actually crossing the boundary of true death
in the real world, promenades act as sendoffs for graduating students in high school, to pursue higher education or something else
but promenades in panprom are representative of a cyclic immortality. the process of casting off a shell through dying in combat, to then be reinstanced in a new shell
battles being called promenades are cool. god
certainly feels unique and shell-like
there is the whole thing of prom crowns literally being coronets, and The Coronet is literally the name of the megastructure the shells are in

PanProm! really is the perfect name for this game, just took some time for me to stumble into it lmao
panopticon/all + promenade/prompt
also despite the high school connotations w/ proms and shit, all shells are prompted as 18+ (though technically they are ageless since they're robots)
the word "prom" doesn't really mean the same thing to the shells and is more of an abstract concept that has been gradually synthesized
their promenades are less about the joy and excitement of finishing and more about the weight of what comes after that
this sense of forever moving forward, forever celebrating what comes next, but they never truly reach a destination, and what comes next never truly comes because of their immortality
if that destination is reached, it's because they no longer exist
most shells don't have any real desire to break out of the cycle, and that awareness of the cycle just something they've accepted over time
or, maybe it's not even a fully conscious realization. more of a vague understanding that they're forever caught in this performance

i guess the whole thing is about being stuck in something that you should have grown out of or moved past long ago
hence why the shells are all adultlike but are all stuck in this eternal promenade
the shells, with all their power and agelessness, are still _caught_ in the act of becoming, without ever fully realizing what it means to actually _be_
the haunting realization that all the time in the world will never be enough
