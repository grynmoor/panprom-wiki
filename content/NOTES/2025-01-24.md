tempted to add a small amount of red somewhere in [[ELEVEN|eleven's]] design. might do it in the form of subtle component lights
might allow for a cool cyan/red chromatic anaglyph effect too
if her hidden eye was red.... that would be neat but maybe too on the nose lol

observation i've had of something i've been doing without realizing it: [[IDOLSHELLS|idolshells]] instanced by normal means do not often possess antennae

its often [[WARSHELLS|warshells]] and [[NAVSHELLS|navshells]] that have them
like [[CERISE|cerise]] and [[PARELLA|parella]] and [[CROQUET|croquet]] don't have any
well ok maybe croquet has them but they're stylized as bunny ears
all [[SHELLS|shells]] do possess earpiece modules around where the ears would but they are typically flat and don't really look like human ears. often covered up by hair as well
but some shells also possess antennae in addition to that
[[ELEVEN|eleven]] has a fun mix of earpieces + antennae
and her earpieces are big enough to not be entirely covered by the hair
[[VESPID|vespid]] also has bigger earpieces and they are cone-shaped
[[GAMMA|gamma]] has an earpiece that also doubles as an antenna
[[FRUTIGER|frutiger]] has one double-pronged antenna on one side of her head, it almost looks like a router
oh wait... parella actually does have horns.. i forgot about that
i guess with idolshells it's harder to tell bc their antennae are often stylized
realizing 11 (the number) visually resembles a pause button
and eleven uses [[STASIS RESON|stasis reson]]
thats cool as fuck actually
im tempted to shove more tv remote themed stuff into the shells
triangle inscribed within circle is already kind of a prominent symbol
and that resembles a play button
also a symbol of unity of the divine and material, and also of sobriety and rehabilitation
mind, body, spirit
also connects to trinity
both the religious concept, and the nuclear bomb hehe
