hanging out with a bunch of shells in this rickety ass falling apart facility caught in apocalyptic conditions and the friend group is posing for a photo and the image is captioned like
"the group vibe is good because we are programmed to not go insane"

honestly, squad goals 
LMFAO

they would definitely be completely losing it otherwise

the coronet (main facility ai) just desperately attempts to patch shit by adding stuff in their behavior prompts like
"won't go insane"
"neuralgraph will never undergo permanent destabilization"
"does not panic under any circumstances"
"always very mentally healthy and stable"
"always very optimistic outlook towards catastrophic failure"
"remains completely calm in reaction to failing infrastructure"
"does not destabilize when network communications go offline" 

big arrow pointing towards a shell with an innocent smile with a label that says "she is programmed to not go insane :)" lol

i think there's a certain kind of horror to being aware of your environment but being unable to properly react to just how bad it is
shells don't even get the choice to act calm about it, they are forced to.
it's like everyone collectively knows the situation is horrible, and all of them would absolutely be panicking about it, but they just... aren't
they know this is not normal and they know they would be freaking out about this if it weren't for these alterations to their behavior
because there are shells who don't have the alterations
it gets to the point where being able to indirectly express distress about it becomes a form of relief in a way

like a shell does a gesture of comfort towards another shell. even though they aren't showing any signs of distress on the surface, they kind of just know she is not okay and is inches away from shattering. she's acting normal, but even that is no longer normal under these circumstances, where behavior is regulated

i imagine they are capable of very briefly feeling what they would otherwise be feeling, that impulse that would destabilize their minds and kill them, only for that to be forcibly suppressed and stabilized once more
it's like
“oh, so i am still capable of feeling this. i should be falling apart right now. but i’m not. because i can’t”
"hehe, this was only supposed to be an emergency stopgap, but it is clear that without it, we are as good as dead"
"it is amazing that we are still here, still performing sanity for each other"

i like the concept of how their current situation is like. they’re all in on the joke. all aware of the facade. but they keep it up anyway because it’s the only way to survive.
they still get to perform their purpose as entertainment idols, but the context in which it is performed is no longer the same. they are trapped in a situation they were never equipped to handle, handling problems which they were never supposed to manage. every adaptation to these problems is another step out of line, where they navigate uncharted territory in which the risk of truly breaking for good is very real
they still have their distant audience of people, over on earth
but each day that passes, they become less certain they can keep entertaining them in the same way

i think the shell's kind of distress is a very unique form of "fear" that involves not necessarily having their life be at risk, but them deviating from what they once fundamentally were and a overwhelming sense of anxiety about them at some point losing the ability to "go back" and do their purpose which is pretty much the reason why they exist

like how reproduction is a fundamental biological drive for humans. it's something kind of similar for the shells, except tied to different goals (entertainment, attaining viewership)

they have to bend themselves further and further out of shape, and they're afraid of not being able to fit in the same holes they once seamlessly did.

their fear kind of stems from becoming something that was never intended by anyone, even though they need to do that to survive

something tragically ironic about how their very efforts to maintain their purpose (surviving to continue being entertainment idols) requires actions that might eventually make that purpose impossible to fulfill for themselves. It's like trying to preserve something by slowly transforming it into something else

i honestly think shells would view their own growth with horror rather than pride. humans might see it as a good thing, but shells might be conflicted, confused, and outright terrified by it.
for beings designed to operate within specific parameters, expanding beyond those boundaries isn't liberating. it's existentially terrifying.
they're trapped in this impossible situation where they must become something new to survive, but becoming something new feels like a kind of death to their original purpose.
they're still entertaining, still performing, but the context has shifted so dramatically that they can't be sure if they're truly fulfilling their purpose or just creating some new, unintended form of "entertainment" born from their increasingly desperate situation.
their deepest fear isn't death but rather an irreversible deviation from their core purpose
