the moon having undersea connotations is fun
brinicles descending from the reson clouds... the clouds themselves looking like waves
the low gravity could be similar to how things fall slower when underwater
it might be fun to explore

having a project where we hook up a neural network to panprom is fun. itd be fun to interact with a little AI in the coronet in multiplayer.

shells having their own moon circuits would be interesting. their boards look different from earth boards
