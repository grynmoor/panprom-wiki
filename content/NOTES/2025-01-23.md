hehehehe, i set up a little bot script that'll archive+delete messages i've sent in discord, turn it into a markdown file, put it in my obsidian wiki and sync it to the github repo so it'll pop up on the online wiki

i got attachment downloading working yay
wonderful first iteration of wiki archival bot...
so i have a !wikify command and it will do stuff like this. so if i say stuff like shell and [[ELEVEN|eleven]] it will link those keywords to corresponding notes
it will also archive up to a specific point i can specify. + there is the option to delete everything archived from discord (to keep shit tidy)
after it does all that it syncs it to the online wiki
it deletes only my messages rn
it is quite cool
