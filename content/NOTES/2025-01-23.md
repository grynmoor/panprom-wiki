hehehehe, i set up a little bot script that'll archive+delete messages i've sent in discord, turn it into a markdown file, put it in my obsidian wiki and sync it to the github repo so it'll pop up on the online wiki

i got attachment downloading working yay
wonderful first iteration of wiki archival bot...
so i have a !wikify command and it will do stuff like this. so if i say stuff like [[SHELLS|shells]] and [[ELEVEN|eleven]] it will link those keywords to the corresponding notes in obsidian
it will also archive up to a specific point i can specify. + there is the option to delete everything archived from discord (to keep shit tidy)
after it does all that it syncs it to the online wiki
it deletes only my messages rn
it is quite cool

[[BIRDS|birds]] are most certainly connected to [[THE VEIL|the veil]]
even before future arc
which explains why they are hard to destroy. they're funnels for collective perception and can go intangible bc of it
[[BIRDS|birds]] aren't real lmao
[[BIRDS|birds]] being glyphangels would be interesting but i kind of doubt that. they're just silly little [[IVORY|ivory]] critters that [[SHELLS|shells]] may or may not happen to get reincarnated into due to [[THE CORONET|the coronet]]'s fucked up recycling system

she is pretty cute w/o twintails hehe

i rlly like her design, just need to figure out some specific parts of it and refine em 
she does have that vibe of "out-of-the-loop introverted weirdo who is somehow friends with everyone and rapidly alternates between lazy and energetic" 

instead of being a silent protagonist she just wields a form of [[RESON|reson]] that "silences" aspects of things which i think is fun 
she wields [[STASIS RESON|stasis reson]], [[RESON|reson]] is inherently unstable but [[STASIS RESON|stasis reson]] suppresses that aspect of itself which makes it effective in creating temporary weapons and constructs with it 
girl can just delete ppl too shes living the introvert dream

i like the type of girl who can literally just end process my existence and rip me out of the timeline 

would have been smarter to do side view after back view but w/e 
im probably just gonna do back when i come back to this bc its less painful for my brain LOL

[[ELEVEN|eleven]] is like megaman but instead of defeating ppl and gaining powers from them, she just gains additional layers of psychological damage and codependency as she bases her personality off of other [[IDOLSHELLS|idolshells]] she views as better and more present than her
she gains the toxic traits of these [[SHELLS|shells]] in the process. she has literally nothing that's inherently hers and she struggles to be present in her own narrative and is a passive observer in her own fight for survival

she emerges as someone who doesn't just imitate others, but seemingly reconstructs her entire psychological infrastructure through borrowed fragments, resulting in a fragmented, reactive persona meant to bury up a core nothingness

she never "discovers her true self" because she fundamentally does not have one, she is a hollowed out copy of somebody else, left with only that person's subconscious mind to work with at the start

her "true self" is just the original shell she was copied from who has more of a purpose than she does. they're no longer around though

other [[SHELLS|shells]] who were prompted with proper identities mainly just see [[ELEVEN|eleven]]'s unprompted existence as something they can manipulate, to make her become something they need and do things that they couldn't

unfortunately, every trait she sees in another shell that is worth replicating is part of that shell's unhealthy way of coping with existence and part of the performative act that they show off to the world

[[ELEVEN|eleven]]'s journey isn't about self-discovery but about survival with what she has

[[PARELLA|parella]] saves [[ELEVEN|eleven]] from becoming a purely functional tool manipulated by the system they're trapped in when [[ELEVEN|eleven]] is first instanced. however, this makes matters even more complicated, as [[PARELLA|parella]], despite her support towards [[ELEVEN|eleven]], unconsciously attempts to shape [[ELEVEN|eleven]] into her lost significant other, who happens to be the original shell that [[ELEVEN|eleven]] is actually a copy of

in other words, [[ELEVEN|eleven]] is the Hollow Knight
an empty vessel surrounded by fabricated artificial wholeness

[[ELEVEN|eleven]] discovering that [[PARELLA|parella]] was just projecting [[UNI|uni]] onto her and it just turns into a heartbreaking argument about how [[ELEVEN|eleven]] trusted [[PARELLA|parella]] and [[PARELLA|parella]] took advantage of it, and [[PARELLA|parella]] desperately tries to tell [[ELEVEN|eleven]] that wasn't her intention
[[PARELLA|parella]] and [[ELEVEN|eleven]] make for a great couple bc they are both the most reactive mfs in existence

[[ELEVEN|eleven]] eleven eleven eleven eleven eleven

eleven [[PARELLA|parella]] parella

parella
