hehehehe, i set up a little bot script that'll archive+delete messages i've sent in discord, turn it into a markdown file, put it in my obsidian wiki and sync it to the github repo so it'll pop up on the online wiki

i got attachment downloading working yay
wonderful first iteration of wiki archival bot...
so i have a !wikify command and it will do stuff like this. so if i say stuff like shell and [[ELEVEN|eleven]] it will link those keywords to corresponding notes
it will also archive up to a specific point i can specify. + there is the option to delete everything archived from discord (to keep shit tidy)
it deletes only my messages rn
it is quite cool
imma record it hold up
