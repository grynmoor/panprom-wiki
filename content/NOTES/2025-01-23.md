hehehehe, i set up a little bot script that'll archive+delete messages i've sent in discord, turn it into a markdown file, put it in my obsidian wiki and sync it to the github repo so it'll pop up on the online wiki

i got attachment downloading working yay
wonderful first iteration of wiki archival bot...
so i have a !wikify command and it will do stuff like this. so if i say stuff like [[SHELLS|shells]] and [[ELEVEN|eleven]] it will link those keywords to the corresponding notes in obsidian
it will also archive up to a specific point i can specify. + there is the option to delete everything archived from discord (to keep shit tidy)
after it does all that it syncs it to the online wiki
it deletes only my messages rn
it is quite cool

[[BIRDS|birds]] are most certainly connected to [[THE VEIL|the veil]]
even before future arc
which explains why they are hard to destroy. they're funnels for collective perception and can go intangible bc of it
[[BIRDS|birds]] aren't real lmao
[[BIRDS|birds]] being glyphangels would be interesting but i kind of doubt that. they're just silly little [[IVORY|ivory]] critters that [[SHELLS|shells]] may or may not happen to get reincarnated into due to [[THE CORONET|the coronet]]'s fucked up recycling system

she is pretty cute w/o twintails hehe

i rlly like her design, just need to figure out some specific parts of it and refine em 
she does have that vibe of "out-of-the-loop introverted weirdo who is somehow friends with everyone and rapidly alternates between lazy and energetic" 

instead of being a silent protagonist she just wields a form of [[RESON|reson]] that "silences" aspects of things which i think is fun 
she wields [[STASIS RESON|stasis reson]], [[RESON|reson]] is inherently unstable but [[STASIS RESON|stasis reson]] suppresses that aspect of itself which makes it effective in creating temporary weapons and constructs with it 
girl can just delete ppl too shes living the introvert dream

i like the type of girl who can literally just end process my existence and rip me out of the timeline 

would have been smarter to do side view after back view but w/e 
im probably just gonna do back when i come back to this bc its less painful for my brain LOL
