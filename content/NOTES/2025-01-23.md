hehehehe, i set up a little bot script that'll archive+delete messages i've sent in discord, turn it into a markdown file, put it in my obsidian wiki and sync it to the github repo so it'll pop up on the online wiki

i got attachment downloading working yay
wonderful first iteration of wiki archival bot...
so i have a !wikify command and it will do stuff like this. so if i say stuff like [[SHELLS|shells]] and [[ELEVEN|eleven]] it will link those keywords to the corresponding notes in obsidian
it will also archive up to a specific point i can specify. + there is the option to delete everything archived from discord (to keep shit tidy)
after it does all that it syncs it to the online wiki
it deletes only my messages rn
it is quite cool

[[BIRDS|birds]] are most certainly connected to [[THE VEIL|the veil]]
even before future arc
which explains why they are hard to destroy. they're funnels for collective perception and can go intangible bc of it
[[BIRDS|birds]] aren't real lmao
[[BIRDS|birds]] being glyphangels would be interesting but i kind of doubt that. they're just silly little [[IVORY|ivory]] critters that [[SHELLS|shells]] may or may not happen to get reincarnated into due to [[THE CORONET|the coronet]]'s fucked up recycling system
