weueueu ueueueueuu [[ELEVEN|1111111111111111111111111111]]
i was not using my brain during this and am gonna have to redraw gauntlet but making progress nonetheless 
ill start side profile tomorrow, just wanted to spend a bit of time on it tonight
that gauntlet is gonna give me trouble bc ive never fully figured out the shape for it.... but i will endure 
i like how Asymmetrical. she is

she has exactly eleven brain cells!
she is working very hard to maintain them all

itd be cool for shells' battles to be called promenades and the arenas are called stages
and rounds are just described as 1st promenade, 2nd promenade, 3rd promenade etc

i love panprom as the new name because i get to make the game use more french/british terminology now 
i think thats hilarious
im tempted to draw but im gonna save it for near the end of the day so i actually develop some kinda fuckin routine
i like eleven's proportions in the rough currently but i might wanna make sure it doesn't look weird compared to the other shells. or maybe not.heheheh hehehe
i literally never checked with cerise
and she looked fine

i thought of a cool meta-concept
the coronet might have dry periods and might not be able to afford to instance certain shells for some time
so content updates that add new shells could be interpreted as the coronet finally being able to afford to make them
(of course it can also just be explained w/ timeline displacement)
though some could just be actually new shells
seeing some shells get instanced after eleven does would be interesting
