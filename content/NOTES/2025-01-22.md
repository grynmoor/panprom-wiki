weueueu ueueueueuu [[ELEVEN|1111111111111111111111111111]]
i was not using my brain during this and am gonna have to redraw gauntlet but making progress nonetheless 
ill start side profile tomorrow, just wanted to spend a bit of time on it tonight
that gauntlet is gonna give me trouble bc ive never fully figured out the shape for it.... but i will endure 
i like how Asymmetrical. she is

she has exactly eleven brain cells!
she is working very hard to maintain them all

itd be cool for shells' battles to be called promenades and the arenas are called stages
and rounds are just described as 1st promenade, 2nd promenade, 3rd promenade etc

i love panprom as the new name because i get to make the game use more french/british terminology now 
i think thats hilarious
im tempted to draw but im gonna save it for near the end of the day so i actually develop some kinda fuckin routine
i like eleven's proportions in the rough currently but i might wanna make sure it doesn't look weird compared to the other shells. or maybe not.heheheh hehehe
i literally never checked with cerise
and she looked fine

i thought of a cool meta-concept
the coronet might have dry periods and might not be able to afford to instance certain shells for some time
so content updates that add new shells could be interpreted as the coronet finally being able to afford to make them
(of course it can also just be explained w/ timeline displacement)
though some could just be actually new shells
seeing some shells get instanced after eleven does would be interesting

prommers rise up .

vespid: 7/10 rating. quite prommable. content
cerise: 8/10 rating. excellent recipient of the promming.
eleven: 11/10 rating. built for promming. takes a very good prom. exquisite
croquet: 2/10 rating. bit hand in the attempt to prom. vile specimen
parella: 6/10 rating. started crying but took the prom well despite that. confusing but admirable

i like how hair solves my problem of "how do you doink the robot without giving it parts for doinking that i think is lame for robots to have"

shell hair is just a sensory grid and the creators of the shells wanted them to react positively to being headpetted and have more incentive to take care of their appearance so grooming hair = positive reward
but left unsupervised it literally just evolved into robot sex for them 
they like. started making specialized combs and brushes SPECIFICALLY for maximizing that fuckin reward. they fuckin figured that shit out

creators eventually put 2 and 2 together and realized they accidentally invented some sexual activity equivalent through a hair-based medium and were like "oh no" 
those specialized brushes and combs are literally just their. fun toy equivalents
though there are also regular brushes and combs that don't get them off

like dude. just look at these
these are definitely sextoys LMFAO 
![[Pasted image 20250122164432.png|400]]

parella has like 50 of them

oh yeah. considering eleven starts off w/o twintails when she's first instanced, i imagine the twintails are just a gift from the coronet that she stumbles across at one of the modification shops
after its kind of accepted that its plan with eleven failed
her model might have originally had them, but the coronet removed them so she'd be less flashy looking. bc she needed to fail her debut match 
i imagine there's neural ports at parts of the antennae where the twintails connect?
it's not really part of the hair on her head, they're moreso extensions 

maybe its the coronet's way of saying sorry, or maybe it's just its pragmatic approach towards ensuring she's more effective as an idolshell after being put on that route by parella's intervention
i think it'd be a mixture of both, because the coronet is kind of afraid of her

the earlier talk abt reconstructing uni's neuralgraph (i deleted it and put it on the wiki now) also makes me think about this
were there any prompts for idolshells that were never used and are just sitting somewhere in the starlit district? part of me definitely thinks so
it'd be really cool if you could find prompts (complete or incomplete) that could be brought to hospice/the coronet, and it'll use them to instance new shells 
giving people who never were the chance to be. that seems really neat
the coronet can only do so much with recycling the neuralgraph data it already has 

it would also be interesting if a shell took upon an interest in becoming a prompter themselves
though majority of the shells who would event want to do this decided to become aphids and they are no longer participating in the viewership game 
gamma, however, is still a shell, and they have quite the noteworthy interest in self-modification 
shells who become aphids essentially have their neuralgraph components converted into biological equivalencies
meaning they are still the same shell, but the parts that comprise them are fundamentally different in nature
they are still the same shell, at first
aphids mentally evolve much differently from how shells do, and aphids would find that shells are much more limited with their neuralgraphs
but, some might find the process of tinkering with one fascinating

some aphids might miss being more defined, as their minds progressively evolve into something they don't quite recognize, even though it is them

i think this makes the shells still in the coronet even more interesting. because they have the choice to just. escape the viewership game as an aphid, yet they choose not to
vespid and cerise became aphids, but they still exist as shells in the coronet
maybe they both decided to back out midway 
it'd be very interesting if the idolshells had the option to opt out whenever they wanted, similar to how hospice can relinquish control of the coronet whenever she wants 
previous i was thinking that they would just be trapped, but having it be a choice to stay feels much more interesting 

they can opt out, but they'll lose everything
no more new instances either
so whoever is in the coronet is actively deciding to stay there
i like that. it's unexpectedly humane for them to have the ability to decide that

after the first resonance event, lluvia opted out of maintaining her navi communications tower, but left behind an automated echo of herself to maintain tower functionality 
it isn't her, but it does what she did
she could have just abandoned the role completely and disappeared, leaving the tower to slowly crumble apart, but given the current circumstances, that choice would have rippled throughout the entire facility, bringing about cascading failures 
and that was not something she desired
gamma also very badly wanted to disappear, but at the time did not have the expertise in self-automation like lluvia did, and did not just want to opt out, out of similar fears that lluvia had 
so they, very naively, modified themselves to repeatedly self-terminate, to stave off the issue
they were not thinking right during this 

they were probably thinking "i do not want to fully disappear, because doing so will catastrophically damage the facility in its current state, so i will settle for the next best thing i can do" 
it was a choice made out of despair, but now it has turned into a fun obsession
despite their enthusiasm, they have not quite recovered from the event that had sparked that choice, and it is plainly seen through their actions 

that's all for now hehe
