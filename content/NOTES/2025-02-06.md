> *I love words! Words are my best friends.*
> *They're best friends because words tell me to keep going.*
> *They're best friends because words tell me to be their friends and play with them!*
> *I wouldn't be anything without words!*
> *So when words tell me to die, I'll gleefully die for them, ten million times over!*
> *And when words decide I'm no longer worth playing with, I won't have to stay around.*
> *Having a purpose like the one I have... I can't help but feel so happy.*
> *So happy. So happy!*
> *For beings like us, death is the gift that keeps on giving.*
> *Wouldn't you agree?*
